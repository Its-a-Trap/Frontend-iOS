Getting Started
------------------ (Make it as easy as possible for me to build and use your app.)




TO-DO:
-----
- test on and iPhone, if possible
- fix crash-on-removing-trap-loaded-from-backend
- tutorial/about page
- clarify that the count is your mines
- cool down for sweep
- implement death
- eliminate the need to add frameworks each time
- all we can show is that score has gone up due to trapping an enemy
- why does login via Facebook send us to a web view?
  (P.S. Jiatao, can you show Carlton how Facebook authentication works?)

DONE:
------
- display user's score at top of screen
- make sweep button look better


DELIVERY
Make sure Jeff has access to the repo, and that the main branch's latest commit is the version you want to submit. I want to do "git clone your-url", read readme.txt, open the project in Xcode, and run it.

Repo should include:
- All source code, data, and project files required to run and test the app.
- I don't want to install any new tools, so include any external libraries you use in your repo.
